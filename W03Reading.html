    Namespacing…
    I thought this stuff was cool and helpful for group projects and projects at work

    Naming collisions occur when the same variable or function name is used for different 
    purposes by code sharing the same scope. This might not seem likely, but imagine if you 
    have lots of code that has been created over time – you might end up reusing a variable 
    name without realizing. The problem becomes more likely if you use code libraries from 
    other developers or work on code in teams, as you might choose the same name for a 
    function as another member of the team.

    JSON…
    I already knew about these functions, but I thought I should write these down to help 
    me know the difference between them

    The parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a JavaScript object

    The stringify() method does the opposite, taking a JavaScript object and returning a string of JSON data

    The RegExp Object...

    A regular expression (or RegExp, for short) is a pattern that can be used to search strings for 
    matches to the pattern. A common use is 'find and replace' type operations. For example, say you
    were looking for any word ending in 'ing', you could use the regular expression /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/ .

    If that example looks a bit confusing, don’t worry, it will become clear as we move through this
    section. Regular expressions can look a little strange; in fact, they're something of a dark art
    that could easily fill a whole book! They are certainly useful when manipulating text strings

    const pattern = /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/;

    RegExp Methods...

    Once you’ve created a regular expression object, you can use the test() method to see if a string
    (passed to the method as a parameter) matches the regular expression pattern. It returns true if
      the pattern is in the string, and false if it isn’t.

    We can see an example of the test() method used below, using the same pattern we created earlier
    that tests if a word ends in 'ing':

    pattern.test('joke');
    << false

    pattern.test('joking');
    << true

    pattern.test('jokingly');
    << false
