        W02Reading Notes

Keep your code DRY (Don't repeat yourself)

__________________________________________________________________________

I found this information interesting about arguments...

function arguments(){
    return arguments;
}

arguments('hello', NaN);
<< { '0': 'hello', '1': NaN }
arguments(1,2,3,4,5);
<< { '0': 1, '1': 2, '2': 3, '3': 4, '4': 5 }

function rest(...args){
    for(arg of args){
        console.log(arg);
    }
}
rest(2,4,6,8);
<< 2
4
6
8

Arrow functions...this is kinda new to me...it really cool though

const square = x => x*x;

const add = (x,y) => x + y;

const hello = () => alert('Hello World!');

const tax = (salary) => {
    const taxable = salary - 8000;
    const lowerRate = 0.25 * taxable;
    taxable = taxable - 20000;
    const higherRate = 0.4 * taxable;
    return lowerRate + higherRate;
}

I was reading about variable hoisting, and I think I knew what it was, but
I just didin't know that it was called hoisting...

Callbacks...

Remember at the start of this chapter when we said that functions in 
JavaScript are first-class objects, so they behave in just the same way as
every other object? This means that functions can also be given as a 
parameter to another function. A function that is passed as an argument 
to another is known as a callback.
