        I watched these videos on transitions and I thought they where really great videos to help me see the potential of transitions
        and it helped me better understand their properties.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nloq6uzF8RQ">Transitions Video #1</a>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYlFFMc0RAg">Transitions Video #2</a>

            transition-property: transform, color; 
            transition-duration: 0.2s;  
            transition-timing-function: ease-out;
            transition-delay: 50ms;


        Here are a few basic animations that might be helpful to reference:

        @keyframes moveRight { 
            from {
            transform: translateX(-50%);
            }
            to {
            transform: translateX(50%);
            }
        }

        @keyframes appearDisappear { 
            0%, 100% {
            opacity: 0;
            }
            20%, 80% {
            opacity: 1;
            }
        }

        @keyframes bgMove {
            100% {
            background-position: 120% 0;
            }
        }

        Here is some shorthand animation properties:
        .verbose {
            animation-name: appearDisappear; 
            animation-duration: 300ms; 
            animation-timing-function: ease-in;
            animation-iteration-count: 1;
            animation-direction: alternate;
            animation-delay: 5s;
            animation-fill-mode: backwards;
            animation-play-state: running;
        }
        /* shorthand */
        .concise {
            animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;
        }

        I watched this video on youtube teaching about canvas and it helped teach me about the capabilities of canvas

        For a very basic look at SVGs I watched this video
