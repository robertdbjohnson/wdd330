        Stack Traces
            An exception will also produce astack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead 
            to the point where the error occurred. Itâ€™s often not just a single function or method call that causes 
            an error. A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the 
            original function or method that started the sequence. The example below shows how a stack trace can 
            help you find where an error originates from:
            function three(){ unicorn(); }
            function two(){ three(); }
            function one(){ two(); }
            one();
            << index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined
                at three (index.html:13)
                at two (index.html:17)
                at one (index.html:21)
                at index.html:24`
                In this example, we have three functions: function one() invokes function two() , which then invokes 
                function three() . Function three() then invokes the unicorn() function that doesn't exist and causes 
                an error. We can use the stack trace to work backwards and see that this error was caused by invoking 
                the function one() in the first place.

        Linting Tools
            Linting tools such asJS Lint,JS Hint,andES Lintcan be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond 
            simply using strict mode. They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, 
            and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented. They can be 
            very unforgiving and use some opinionated coding conventions, such as not using the ++ and -- increment 
            operators (in the case of JS Lint). Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programmingstyle guide. 
            This is particularly useful when you are working in a team, as it ensures everybody follows the same conventions.
                
            It's possible to add a linting tool as a text-editor plugin; this will then highlight any sloppy code as 
            you type. Another option is to use an online linting tool that allows you to simply paste onto a page for 
            feedback. Another option is to install linting software on your computer using npm. This can then be run 
            as part of your workflow.
                
            Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will mean it will be more consistent 
                and less likely to have problems.
                
            You can read more about how to use ESLint inthis article on SitePoint.
            
        What I've found helpful for me throughout my coding experience is that using the console helps me figure out a
        lot of basic coding problems and helps me figure out where the problem is and what it might be that is the problem.

        Throwing Exceptions
            function squareRoot(number) {
                'use strict';
                if (number < 0) {
                    throw new RangeError('You can't find the square root of negative numbers')
                }
                return Math.sqrt(number);
            };
